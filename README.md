# value-search
This project revolves around creating a platform for users to create a professional profile and apply for jobs/positions 
that match the values users have stated in their profile. Basic auth allows for a user to register/login and create a profile. 
Once logged in, the user can search for job listings/positions he/she is interested in. The app will generate a response based 
on user profile metrics such as experience and personal values.

I was inspired to built this for two main reasons:

  1. At the time of building the site, I am in the process of searching for new work/professional opportunities. I noticed 
  exisitng platforms lacked depth in building out profiles, so I wanted to take it one step further and use personal value systems as 
  a variable when searching for jobs. Finding a company that aligns with your values and your mission is super important.
  
  2. As with anything, practice makes permanent. This project has taught me a lot about the ins and outs of react.js and how data 
  flows is managed throughout the framework. I've made a lot of progress in my understanding of react and I still have so much to learn.
